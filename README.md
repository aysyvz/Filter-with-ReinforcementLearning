# Filter-with-ReinforcementLearning

Example of Simple Simple Q-Learning with Reinforcement Learning algorithm for ozone filter to decide on or off according to ozone level.

This algorithm for ozone filter which includes 5 filter layer. The aim is to ensure that the incoming ozone level does not fall below the lower limit value and does not exceed the upper limit value. In order for the filters to last longer, the agent trained with q-learning decides which layer will be opened and closed at which ozone level, avoiding the use of unnecessary filters.
